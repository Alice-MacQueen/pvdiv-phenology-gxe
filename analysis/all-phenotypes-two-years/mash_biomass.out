Loading required namespace: mashr
Estimating the correlation structure in the null tests from the random data.
                 (not the strong data because it will not necessarily contain
                 any null tests).
Setting up the main data objects with this correlation structure in place.
Now estimating data-driven covariances using the strong tests.
                   NB: This step may take some time to complete.
Fit mash to the random tests using both data-driven and canonical covariances.
 - Computing 256840 x 461 likelihood matrix.
 - Likelihood calculations took 277.34 seconds.
 - Fitting model with 461 mixture components.
 - Model fitting took 165.57 seconds.
Compute posterior matrices for the strong effects using the mash fit from the
                 random tests.
 - Computing 25684 x 461 likelihood matrix.
 - Likelihood calculations took 24.60 seconds.
 - Computing posterior matrices.
 - Computation allocated took 687.92 seconds.
