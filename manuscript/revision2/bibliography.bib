	abstract = {Although temperature is an important driver of seasonal changes in photosynthetic physiology, photoperiod also regulates leaf activity. Climate change will extend growing seasons if temperature cues predominate, but photoperiod-controlled species will show limited responsiveness to warming. We show that photoperiod explains more seasonal variation in photosynthetic activity across 23 tree species than temperature. Although leaves remain green, photosynthetic capacity peaks just after summer solstice and declines with decreasing photoperiod, before air temperatures peak. In support of these findings, saplings grown at constant temperature but exposed to an extended photoperiod maintained high photosynthetic capacity, but photosynthetic activity declined in saplings experiencing a naturally shortening photoperiod; leaves remained equally green in both treatments. Incorporating a photoperiodic correction of photosynthetic physiology into a global-scale terrestrial carbon-cycle model significantly improves predictions of seasonal atmospheric CO2 cycling, demonstrating the benefit of such a function in coupled climate system models. Accounting for photoperiod-induced seasonality in photosynthetic parameters reduces modeled global gross primary production 2.5\% (∼4 PgC y−1), resulting in a {\textgreater}3\% (∼2 PgC y−1) decrease of net primary production. Such a correction is also needed in models estimating current carbon uptake based on remotely sensed greenness. Photoperiod-associated declines in photosynthetic capacity could limit autumn carbon gain in forests, even if warming delays leaf senescence.},

    abstract = "{We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including estimating false discovery rates (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This “unimodal assumption” (UA), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient and robust computation—estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem—and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (\\$p\\$ value or \\$z\\$ score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods, our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures, we introduce the term “local false sign rate” to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable and can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package ashr available from http://github.com/stephens999/ashr.}",

	abstract = {Genetic effects on complex traits may depend on context, such as age, sex, environmental exposures or social settings. However, it is often unclear if the extent of context dependency, or Gene-by-Environment interaction (GxE), merits more involved models than the additive model typically used to analyze data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we suggest considering the utility of GxE models in GWAS as a tradeoff between bias and variance parameters. In particular, We derive a decision rule for choosing between competing models for the estimation of allelic effects. The rule weighs the increased estimation noise when context is considered against the potential bias when context dependency is ignored. In the empirical example of GxSex in human physiology, the increased noise of context-specific estimation often outweighs the bias reduction, rendering GxE models less useful when variants are considered independently. However, we argue that for complex traits, considering patterns of context dependency across many variants jointly can improve both estimation and trait prediction. Finally, we exemplify (using GxDiet effects on longevity in fruit flies) how considering polygenic trends of GxE may also be important for interpretation, as analyses based on independently ascertained {\textquotedblleft}top hits{\textquotedblright} alone can be misleading.Significance Statement Genome-wide association studies have shown surprisingly little evidence for genetic effects on complex traits depending on context (e.g., age, sex, environmental exposures). At the same time, we have learned from the last two decades of GWAS that additive trait variation is often due to small contributions from large parts of the genome. This observation shifted our perspective and sparked a methodological effort to analyze these subtler and harder to interpret associations from throughout the genome together with core genes. Here, we argue through theory and empirical example that a similar shift in the consideration of high polygenicity is an important piece missing from our understanding of context-specificity in complex traits.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
