            V(D)J rearrangements occur within loci of TCR and BCR genes, thus generating the diversity of the AgR repertoire. In addition, interlocus V(D)J rearrangements occur, giving rise to so-called “trans-rearrangements.” Such trans-rearrangements increase the diversity of the immune receptor repertoire and can be expressed as functional chimeric TCR proteins on the surface of T cells. Although chimeric receptors are not pathogenic per se, the frequency of AgR trans-rearrangements correlates with the level of genetic instability and thus could be used as a predictive biomarker for lymphoma risk.},

	abstract = {Pilot studies in human populations have demonstrated a correlation between the level of antigen receptor trans-rearrangements and risk (at the population level) of lymphoid malignancy. Irradiation of newborn severe combined immune deficiency mice results in an increased risk of subsequent development of thymic lymphoma (100\% of mice so irradiated are dead of thymic lymphoma by 20 weeks of age). We, therefore, assayed the occurrence of trans-rearrangements in this well-controlled mouse mutant system and found a 50–100-fold increase in the absolute number of TCRGV-TCRBJ trans-rearrangements compared to unirradiated littermates (and a comparable fold increase over age-matched BALB/c mice) at 2 weeks following irradiation. We also found a marked disproportion in generating trans-rearrangements versus intralocus rearrangements in the severe combined immune deficiency system compared to BALB/c, independent of irradiation. The trans-rearrangements noted were polyclonal in nature. These data, again, suggest that the absolute level of antigen receptor trans-rearrangements may serve as a biomarker of lymphoma risk.},

	abstract = {V(D)J [variable-(diversity)-joining] rearrangements occur between, as well as within, immune receptor loci, resulting in the generation of hybrid antigen-receptor genes and the formation of a variety of lymphocyte-specific chromosomal aberrations. Such hybrid genes occur at a low frequency in the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of normal individuals but show a markedly increased incidence in the PBL of individuals with the autosomal recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia. In this manuscript we demonstrate that the frequency of hybrid antigen-receptor genes is 10- to 20-fold increased in the PBL of an occupational group, agriculture workers, with related environmental exposures. Both ataxia-telangiectasia patients and this population of agriculture workers are at increased risk for lymphoid malignancy. This result suggests that the measurement of hybrid antigen receptor-genes in PBL may be a sensitive assay for a type of lymphocyte-specific genomic instability. As a corollary, this assay may identify populations at risk of developing common types of lymphoid malignancy.},

	abstract = {In this paper, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we demonstrated the occurrence of hybrid genes formed by interlocus recombination between T cell receptor gamma (TCR-gamma) variable (V) regions and TCR-beta joining (J) regions in the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from normal individuals and patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT). Sequence analysis of the PCR-derived hybrid genes confirmed that site-specific V gamma-J beta recombination had occurred and showed that 10 of 23 genomic hybrid genes maintained a correct open reading frame. By dilution analysis, the frequency of these hybrid genes was 8 +/- 1/10(5) cells in normal PBL and 587 +/- 195/10(5) cells in AT PBL. These frequencies and the approximately 70-fold difference between the normal and AT samples are consistent with previous cytogenetic data examining the occurrence of an inversion of chromosome 7 in normal and AT PBL. We also demonstrated expression of these hybrid genes by PCR analysis of first-strand cDNA prepared from both normal and AT PBL. Sequence analysis of the PCR-amplified transcripts showed that, in contrast to the genomic hybrid genes, 19 of 22 expressed genes maintained a correct open reading frame at the V-J junction and correctly spliced the hybrid V-J exon to a TCR-beta constant region, thus allowing translation into a potentially functional hybrid TCR protein. Another type of hybrid TCR transcript was found in a which a rearranged TCR-gamma V-J exon was correctly spliced to a TCR-beta constant region. This form of hybrid gene may be formed by trans-splicing. These hybrid TCR genes may serve to increase the repertoire of the immune response. In addition, studies of their mechanism of formation and its misregulation in AT may provide insight into the nature of the chromosomal instability syndrome associated with AT. The mechanism underlying hybrid gene formation may be analogous to the mechanism underlying rearrangements between putative growth-affecting genes and the antigen receptor loci, which are associated with AT lymphocyte clones and lymphoid malignancies.},

	abstract = {Although temperature is an important driver of seasonal changes in photosynthetic physiology, photoperiod also regulates leaf activity. Climate change will extend growing seasons if temperature cues predominate, but photoperiod-controlled species will show limited responsiveness to warming. We show that photoperiod explains more seasonal variation in photosynthetic activity across 23 tree species than temperature. Although leaves remain green, photosynthetic capacity peaks just after summer solstice and declines with decreasing photoperiod, before air temperatures peak. In support of these findings, saplings grown at constant temperature but exposed to an extended photoperiod maintained high photosynthetic capacity, but photosynthetic activity declined in saplings experiencing a naturally shortening photoperiod; leaves remained equally green in both treatments. Incorporating a photoperiodic correction of photosynthetic physiology into a global-scale terrestrial carbon-cycle model significantly improves predictions of seasonal atmospheric CO2 cycling, demonstrating the benefit of such a function in coupled climate system models. Accounting for photoperiod-induced seasonality in photosynthetic parameters reduces modeled global gross primary production 2.5\% (∼4 PgC y−1), resulting in a {\textgreater}3\% (∼2 PgC y−1) decrease of net primary production. Such a correction is also needed in models estimating current carbon uptake based on remotely sensed greenness. Photoperiod-associated declines in photosynthetic capacity could limit autumn carbon gain in forests, even if warming delays leaf senescence.},
