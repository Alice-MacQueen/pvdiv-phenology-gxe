Cribbed from Li *et al.,* 2019 (PNAS paper: Genomic and environmental determinants and their interplay underlying phenotypic plasticity).

    * Photothermal time within a growth period is a major environmental determinant for flowering time and can be used as an environmental index.
    * Robust performance predictions can be made for untested individuals in untested environments.

1. Extensive phenotyping and genetic analysis was conducted with a four-way mapping population and with a diversity panel.
1. Environments were grouped by temperature, photoperiod, and the observed greenup and flowering times of the population.
1. Environments were ordered according to the population mean at each environment. Perhaps just for individuals that are found at all 7 sites, at least in the GWAS panel.
1. Joint regression analysis where observed phenotypes are modeled as response curves across the environmental gradient (which was quantified by the population means of all individuals). Finlay-Wilkerson.
1. Make environmental indexes to connect tested environments with new environments.
